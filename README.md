# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a given data set. The 'run_analysis.R' script merges the 'testing' and 'training' data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset", extracts the values for mean and standard deviation variables, and then finds the average (mean) of the extracted variables for the included subjects. The resulting 'clean' dataset is stored as 'cleaned_and_averaged_data.txt'.

## Files
1. Analysis script (run_analysis.R)
2. Cleaned data (cleaned_data.txt)
3. Averaged data (cleaned_and_averaged_data.txt)
4. CodeBook (code_book.md)

## Original Data
The original data used can be found in the 'train' and 'test' folders, along with the 'features.txt' and 'activity_labels.txt' files

## More Information
See the CodeBook for more information
