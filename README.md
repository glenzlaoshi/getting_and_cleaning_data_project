# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a given data set. The 'run_analysis.R' script merges the 'testing' and 'training' data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and then finds the average (mean) of the included variables for the included subjects. The resulting 'clean' dataset is stored as 'cleaned_and_averaged_data.txt'.
